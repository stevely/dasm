dasm - An assembler for the DCPU

Current target version: 1.7

Goals:
-No dependencies beyond C standard library and make
-Fast
-Descriptive error messages

Includes:
-Full instruction set
-Numeric support for hex and decimal
-DAT fields
-String support
-HCF included

Todo:
-Labels corresponding to values at or under 30 used as part of an A value don't
 currently get optimized into short-form literals.
-Escape sequences for strings.
-Support for binary numbers.

Building:
 With clang:
  Go to the root dasm directory and run "make"
 With gcc:
  Go to the root dasm directory and run "make gcc"

Notes:
 Development is done with the clang C compiler and static analyzer. A separate
build target is included to use gcc instead (make gcc). This target assumes no
static analyzer. To use clang but skip static analysis (as it can be slow), do
"make ANALYZER=".
